                    <p className='text-[#565656]'>Maize was used merely as a test crop for soil fertility to determine the influence of green manners and various sequences of crops in the rotation. Maize has been in the diet of Nigerians for centuries. It started as a subsistence crop and has gradually become a more important crop. Maize has now risen to a commercial crop on which many 
                        agro-based industries depend on as raw materials.
                         Although maize is increasingly being utilized for livestock feed, it is still a very important staple food for millions of Nigerians. Maize in Nigeria is mainly produced by smallholder farmers, each cultivating an average of 0.65Ha (Sahel Reports, 2014). Cropping systems differ from North to South.
                         Northern farmers typically do not practice intercropping. While, in the South, maize is usually intercropped with yam, cassava, guinea corn, rice, cowpea, groundnut, and soybeans.</p>

                    <p className='text-[#565656]'>Maize was domesticated in central Mexico around 1500BC, was introduced into Africa around 1500 AD, and spread to every corner of the continent within 
                        a relatively short period and is now Africaâ€™s most important cereal crop.</p>
