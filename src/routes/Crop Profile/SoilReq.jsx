                     Maize is known as a nitrogen hungry crop, planting this crop in a soil rich in nitrogen will positively impact its growth and yield.
                     The farmland site to be used for maize farming should be ideally plain or flat. The soil should be well drained. Maize will not do well in a water-logged area.
                     Soils that are too clayey or muddy should be avoided because they can be prone to flooding, they also usually have a low content of calcium.
                      Your preferred location or site for maize farming should have a soil that is not too acidic or too alkaline.
                     Maize will do well in soils with a pH of 5.5 â€“ 6.5.
