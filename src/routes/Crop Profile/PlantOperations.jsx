              Preparing The Land
            </h1>
            <p className="text-[#565656]">
              Land preparation is easier, cheaper and faster in the savanna belt
              of Nigerian than the rain forest belt because the rain forest belt
              is too dense with a lot of trees and vegetation. Land preparation
              breaks up the texture of the soil and improves oxygen penetration
              into the soil, this helps the plants on the soil to grow well.
              Land preparation also improves the penetration of water into the
              soil and the efficacy of fertilizers applied on the soil. Animals
              and tractors can be used for ploughing, harrowing and ridging,
              however, for large maize farms, the use of tractors is better and
              more efficient. They can also be used for planting of the maize
              seeds. There are cheap planters in Nigeria that you can buy to
              facilitate the planting of maize seeds.
